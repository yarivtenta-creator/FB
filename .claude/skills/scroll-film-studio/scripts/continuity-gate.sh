#
# Proves the film is ONE CONTINUOUS CAMERA MOVE — not a sequence of shots.
#
# WHY A SEAM GATE IS NOT ENOUGH. Chaining sets each clip's start image to the
# previous clip's last frame, so the seams match BY CONSTRUCTION and cannot fail.
# What escapes is the middle of each clip. On 25 Jul 2026 an amber film scored
# 0.94/0.94/0.96 at all three junctions while frames inside the clips jump-cut
# and then froze for 17 consecutive frames. Two websites were built on it.
#
# WHY ABSOLUTE SSIM IS ALSO NOT ENOUGH — the mistake this script made first.
# SSIM measures pixel similarity, not continuity. A fast but perfectly smooth
# dolly changes most of the frame and scores ~0.49; a hard cut between two
# visually similar frames scores high. A fixed threshold therefore REJECTS good
# fast camera work and can WAVE THROUGH cuts. The first version of this gate
# failed a flawless Veo 3.1 shot at median 0.49 — a single unbroken push from a
# meadow into a hive interior — and would have thrown the best footage away.
#
# WHAT ACTUALLY SEPARATES A CUT FROM MOTION is the LOCAL SHAPE of the curve:
#   • smooth motion  → values consistent with their neighbours, however low
#   • a hard cut     → a sudden collapse far below the LOCAL median
#   • a freeze       → ~1.0, the camera stopped: a dead scroll zone
# So every pair is judged against its own local baseline, never a global constant.
#
#   PASS  no pair below 45% of its local median, and at most 2 frozen pairs
#   FAIL  otherwise — regenerate; do NOT build on it
#
# VERIFIED AGAINST (step 4):
#   veo3 both-ends-pinned meadow→hive   median 0.49, no cuts   -> PASS (correct)
#   amber k3 film                        17 frozen + collapses -> FAIL (correct)
