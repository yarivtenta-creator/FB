"""vector-check.py <storyboard.json> — audit the film's direction of travel.

Free, instant, and run BEFORE any credits are spent. It catches the failure that
no downstream gate can see: a film whose junctions are all perfect and whose
camera still wanders.

The continuity gate proves each clip is one unbroken move. It cannot prove the
moves point the same way. A film can pass every seam and every continuity check
and still read as a reel of unrelated shots, because the visitor is scrolling in
ONE direction and the camera is not.

  in-words   the camera closes on something
  out-words  the camera withdraws from it
  A clip containing both reverses on itself mid-shot.
  A clip containing neither has no instruction, and the model invents one.

Declare the film's vector in the storyboard as "vector": "..." and one intended
reversal may be declared as "reversal_at": "<clip id>" — fritz-kola descends to
the bottom of the bottle and rises out through the neck, and that turn is the
whole idea. An UNDECLARED reversal is the bug.

# up the neck" is a reorientation, and a clip that only reorients genuinely does
# not advance the journey, so being flagged as directionless is the right answer.
