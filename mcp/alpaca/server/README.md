## Upgrading from V1

V2 is a **complete rewrite** built with FastMCP and OpenAPI. **None of the V1 tools exist in V2** — tool names, parameters, and schemas have changed. You cannot use V2 as a drop-in replacement if your setup depends on specific V1 tool names or parameters.

### What changes


| Aspect             | V1                                     | V2                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tool names**     | Hand-crafted (e.g. `get_account_info`) | Spec-derived with overrides (e.g. `get_account_info` — names may overlap but schemas differ) |
| **Parameters**     | Custom schemas                         | Aligned with Alpaca API specs                                                                |
| **Configuration**  | `.env` + `init` command                | Env vars in MCP client config only                                                           |
| **Tool filtering** | Not supported                          | `ALPACA_TOOLSETS` env var                                                                    |
| **Whitelisting**   | Not supported                          | Use `ALPACA_TOOLSETS` to restrict tools                                                      |


### How to avoid V1-style usage in V2

MCP clients discover tools dynamically from the server. There is no config file where you "whitelist" tool names — the client gets whatever tools the server exposes. To avoid your client or AI assistant using V2 incorrectly:

1. **Do not reuse V1 config** — Treat V2 as a new server. Update your MCP client config with the new command/args; remove any `.env` or `init`-based setup.
2. **Clear tool caches** — Restart your MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, etc.) after switching so it fetches the new tool list instead of using a stale one.
3. **Start a fresh chat/session** — Existing conversations may have cached references to old tool names. Start a new chat so the LLM sees the current V2 tools and their schemas.
4. **Update custom instructions and rules** — If you have Cursor rules, Claude instructions, or other prompts that mention specific V1 tool names (e.g. "use `get_account_info`"), update them to match V2 tool names or remove those references and let the LLM discover tools from context.
5. **Restrict tools with** `ALPACA_TOOLSETS` — If you previously limited which capabilities your assistant could use, V2 supports server-side filtering via the `ALPACA_TOOLSETS` env var. See [Configuration > Toolset Filtering](#toolset-filtering) for the list of toolsets.

### Summary

Assume **no backward compatibility** with V1. Reconfigure your MCP client for V2, restart it, and use a fresh session. Check the [Available Tools](#available-tools) section for the current tool list.

### If you had custom V1 workflows

If you documented allowed tools, wrote scripts that call tools by name, or built prompts around specific V1 tool/parameter shapes — treat them as obsolete. Recreate them using the [Available Tools](#available-tools) listed below and the current parameter schemas exposed by the server.

### Staying on V1

If you need to stay on V1, pin to the last V1 release (e.g. `uvx alpaca-mcp-server==1.x.x serve`) in your MCP client config. V1 remains available on PyPI for existing setups.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** ([installation guide](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **uv** ([installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))
- **Alpaca Trading API keys** (free paper trading account)
- **MCP client** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, etc.)

## Getting Your API Keys

1. Visit the [Alpaca Dashboard](https://app.alpaca.markets/paper/dashboard/overview)
2. Create a free paper trading account
3. Generate API keys from the dashboard

## Setup

Add the server to your MCP client config, then restart the client. No `init` command, no `.env` files — credentials are set in **one place only**.

### Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Mac) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alpaca": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["alpaca-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key",
        "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Mobile

Alpaca does not provide a hosted remote MCP server. To use the MCP server on the Claude mobile app, host it remotely on a cloud provider, then add it as a custom connector in Claude. The connector syncs to the mobile app once connected on the web.

For hosting, deployment, and connector setup, see [How to Deploy Alpaca's MCP Server Remotely on Claude Mobile App](https://alpaca.markets/learn/how-to-deploy-alpaca-mcp-server-remotely-on-claude-mobile-app).

### ChatGPT

Alpaca does not provide a hosted remote MCP server. To use the MCP server in ChatGPT, host it remotely on a cloud provider, then add it as a connector.

See [Connectors in ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487775-connectors-in-chatgpt) and the [Claude Mobile deployment guide](https://alpaca.markets/learn/how-to-deploy-alpaca-mcp-server-remotely-on-claude-mobile-app) for hosting and setup steps.

### Cursor

Install from the [Cursor Directory](https://cursor.directory/mcp/alpaca) in a few clicks, or add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alpaca": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["alpaca-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key",
        "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### VS Code

Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project root. See the [official docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "alpaca": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "uvx",
        "args": ["alpaca-mcp-server"],
        "env": {
          "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key",
          "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### PyCharm

See the [official guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ai-assistant/configure-an-mcp-server.html).

1. Go to File → Settings → Tools → Model Context Protocol (MCP)
2. Add a new server:
  - **Type**: stdio
  - **Command**: uvx
  - **Arguments**: alpaca-mcp-server
3. Set environment variables:
  ```
   ALPACA_API_KEY=your_alpaca_api_key
   ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_alpaca_secret_key
  ```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add alpaca --scope user --transport stdio uvx alpaca-mcp-server \
  --env ALPACA_API_KEY=your_alpaca_api_key \
  --env ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_alpaca_secret_key
```

Verify with `/mcp` in the Claude Code CLI.

### Antigravity CLI

See the [Antigravity MCP docs](https://antigravity.google/docs/mcp).

Add to `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/mcp_config.json` (global) or `.agents/mcp_config.json` (workspace):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alpaca": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["alpaca-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_alpaca_api_key",
        "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_alpaca_secret_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-mcp-server.git
cd alpaca-mcp-server
docker build -t mcp/alpaca:latest .
```

Add to your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alpaca": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "--rm", "-i",
        "-e", "ALPACA_API_KEY=your_key",
        "-e", "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret",
        "-e", "ALPACA_PAPER_TRADE=true",
        "mcp/alpaca:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration

All configuration is through environment variables set in your MCP client config. No files are written to disk.


| Variable             | Required | Default | Description                                |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `ALPACA_API_KEY`     | Yes      | —       | Your Alpaca API key                        |
| `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY`  | Yes      | —       | Your Alpaca secret key                     |
| `ALPACA_PAPER_TRADE` | No       | `true`  | Set to `false` for live trading            |
| `ALPACA_TOOLSETS`    | No       | all     | Comma-separated list of toolsets to enable |


### Switching to Live Trading

Update the `env` block in your MCP client config and restart:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ALPACA_API_KEY": "your_live_api_key",
    "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "your_live_secret_key",
    "ALPACA_PAPER_TRADE": "false"
  }
}
```

### Toolset Filtering

By default, all tools are enabled. To limit the server to specific toolsets, set `ALPACA_TOOLSETS`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ALPACA_API_KEY": "...",
    "ALPACA_SECRET_KEY": "...",
    "ALPACA_TOOLSETS": "stock-data,crypto-data"
  }
}
```

Available toolsets:

### ReadMe Docs MCP

Docs are scoped to the Trading API, Market Data API, and Authentication API specs; Broker API endpoint docs are intentionally excluded from this server.

If the ReadMe MCP lookup fails, tool responses include fallback links to Alpaca's public docs plus `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt`.

## Troubleshooting

- **uv/uvx not found**: Install uv from the official guide ([https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)) and then restart your terminal so `uv`/`uvx` are on PATH.
- **Credentials missing**: Set `ALPACA_API_KEY` and `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY` in the client's `env` block. Paper mode default is `ALPACA_PAPER_TRADE = True`.
- **Client didn't pick up new config**: Restart the client (Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code) after changes.
- **HTTP port conflicts**: If using `--transport streamable-http`, change `--port` to a free port.
